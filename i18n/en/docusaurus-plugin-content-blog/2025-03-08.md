Invero and its documentation are now maintained by 8aka-Team

Due to limited maintainer resources, this plugin may not be frequently maintained. We recommend using [TrMenu Community Edition](https://github.com/CoderKuo/TrMenu)

Code repositories:

* [Invero](https://github.com/8aka-Team/Invero)
* [Invero Documentation](https://github.com/8aka-Team/Invero-Docs)

## Future Plans

* Improve item library support (to match TrMenu Community Edition standards)
* Replace Nashorn with GraalJS
* Fix some bugs
* ~~Steal features and write them into TrMenu Community Edition~~

## Some Other Thoughts

A year ago when I first entered the community, I asked my first question in the TrMenu discussion group: "Where can I buy Invero?". At that time, Arasple had already stopped selling it (which led to some amusing incidents, but I won't mention them).

However, this question introduced me to the Station, which led to NitWikit and 8aka-Team (this was when I first entered the community; I only got QQ in my third year of junior high, but I started running servers in my first year).

A year later, it became a boomerang. I went from being a newbie who wanted to buy Invero to becoming one of its maintainers. History's boomerang finally hit me.
