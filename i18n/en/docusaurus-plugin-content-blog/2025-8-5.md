Hello everyone! I am postyizhan, the current maintainer of Invero.

The previous blog was written by lilingfeng, who said that the plugin would not be frequently maintained, but in fact, he didn't maintain it at all (crossing arms and pouting).

All the work was done by me, but I didn't even write a blog post (sigh).

So, let's get started!

First of all, thank you to all the users who have supported Invero over the years. It is your support that has allowed this plugin to continue.

Secondly, thank you to all the developers who have contributed to Invero. It is your contributions that have made this plugin even better.

Lastly, thank you to all the users who have provided feedback and suggestions. It is your feedback that has made this plugin more user-friendly.

Now, let's talk about the latest update. Invero 1.4.2 has been released!

In addition to the global node feature, we have also completed the item library support, which rounds up lilingfeng's big cake!

Currently, Invero supports 16 item libraries (AzuraFlow joined after 1.4.2 was released, and Ratzel actively supports Invero)

In addition, [Lythrilla](https://github.com/Lythrilla) has once again refactored the Invero style and added i18n support!

Invero is now available in English!
