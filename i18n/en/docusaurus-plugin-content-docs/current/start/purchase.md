## How to Learn

Invero as a menu plugin is not complex in itself,  
The difficulty for beginners is simply how to logicalize their expected functionality and express it in the form of configuration and scripts.

For beginners with a weak technical foundation, please refer to the following learning path:

- **Learn YAML Basics**
  - "YAML Configuration File Syntax" https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/616843858
  - "YAML Tutorial" https://www.runoob.com/w3cnote/yaml-intro.html

- **Learn Kether Scripts**
  - "Kether Cooking Guide" https://www.yuque.com/sacredcraft/kether

- **Get Started with Invero**
  - Read this documentation completely
  - Refer to related examples in group files

> Many people's understanding of YAML is only based on experience, re-learning the related syntax will be very helpful  
> Learning Kether scripts is the top priority, as it relates to the implementation of all custom functions in menus

You don't need to panic, the above content is completely sufficient as long as you take time to read it carefully.  
But if you don't read anything and come asking questions that are repeatedly mentioned in the above documentation, I won't help you either.
